# Discord Xbox Controller
This is a self-hosted bot that acts as a a regular Xbox 360 controller on the host PC.

## Notes about this software
* You need to host this bot yourself, which also need you need to create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* I do not take responsiblity of any probably this causes on your devices, this has only been tested on a relatively small scale and I'm not super familar with Discord bots nor ViGem

## What do I use it for?
This tool is perfect for streams such as 'Twitch Plays Pokemon' but where you want to very directly limit whose in control, i.e. a discord community! I intend to make it possible to set a role limit or channel limit on it in the future.
