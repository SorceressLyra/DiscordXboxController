# Discord Xbox Controller
This is a self-hosted bot that acts as a a regular Xbox 360 controller on the host PC.

## Notes about this software
* You need to host this bot yourself, which also need you need to create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* I do not take responsiblity of any problems this can cause on your device, this has only been tested on a relatively small scale and I'm not super familar with Discord bots nor ViGem

## What do I use it for?
This tool is perfect for streams such as 'Twitch Plays Pokemon' but where you want to very directly limit whose in control, i.e. a discord community! I intend to make it possible to set a role limit or channel limit on it in the future.

## How do I set up the bot?
### Where do I add my token?
When you have created a discord application and bot you need to add your token to the bot, luckily you don't need to touch any code for this.

All you have to do is to go to your appdata\roaming, add a folder called BotToken and then add your token in there saved within a txt file, the software will automatically grab the token from there.

`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\BotToken\token.txt`

### What permissions should the Bot have?

## What is coming?
I am going to add the ability to limit the bot to certain roles or a Channel, this will arrive in the coming weeks/months
